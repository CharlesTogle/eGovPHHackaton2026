CONTEXT:
- Disaster Event: ${headline}
- Event Type: ${eventType}
- Severity Level: ${severity}
- Framework: NDRRMC RDANA (Rapid Damage Assessment and Needs Analysis)
- Reporting Standards: DSWD DROMIC, BDRRM CP Forms 4A/6/8

OFFICIAL 5-SECTION RDANA STRUCTURE:
- SECTION I: General Disaster Profile & Geographic Location
- SECTION II: Human Impact & Displaced Population (Inside/Outside ECs)
- SECTION III: Lifelines, Infrastructure & Critical Facilities Status
- SECTION IV: Sectoral Damage & Urgent Humanitarian Needs Clusters
- SECTION V: Local Response Capacity & Recommended Augmentation Requests

RDANA ASSESSMENT CATEGORIES AND SAMPLE QUESTIONS:

${categoryBlocks}

TASK:
Generate a concise set of 4-6 assessment questions for this specific disaster event.
Each question must:
1. Be written in simple, clear English (understandable by Filipino citizens on basic smartphones)
2. Be answerable with Yes/No
3. Map to exactly one RDANA need_category code: ${categories.map(c => c.code).join(', ')}
4. Be directly relevant to the disaster type (${eventType}) and severity (${severity})
5. Prioritize life-safety questions first, then shelter, then basic needs
6. Align with the Official 5-Section RDANA Structure to gather data for Sections II, III, and IV.

Return ONLY a JSON array of objects with fields: question_text, need_category, display_order
Example: [{"question_text": "Is your home damaged?", "need_category": "shelter", "display_order": 0}]`
}
